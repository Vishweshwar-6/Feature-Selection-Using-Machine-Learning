# Feature-Selection-Using-Machine-Learning
This project demonstrates various feature selection techniques in machine learning, including filter methods (correlation, chi-square), wrapper methods (RFE, forward selection), and embedded methods (Lasso, Random Forest). By selecting the most relevant features, the project aims to improve model performance and interpretability.
